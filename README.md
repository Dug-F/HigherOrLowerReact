# HigherOrLowerReact

Useful when taking part in a game where cards are being drawn and you have to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower.

As each card is drawn, click on the corresponding card on the displayed page.  The probabilities of the next card being higher or lower will be displayed.

If the same ranked card is drawn, the probabilities are not shown, as the expectation is that there will be another draw.

If you clicked on the wrong card, no problem.  Just click on the card again and it will be de-selected and the deck state will be reset to before you clicked on the card.

Good luck!
